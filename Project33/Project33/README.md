This code is about writing function to convert miles to kilometer and from kilometer to miles...
Also it contains other function that is written to get the area of a rectangle 
The last function involves printing of some prefix warning messages in some kind of specified way which is already defined in the function 
for this code the functions were all written first before the main codes which is the body that will work with the function 
what i noticed about this functions is just that it's values/paramter are defined first before the ogic is being written 
and also we use program . the function name to make the function work with the object that is assign to work with the function 
The name "Program is the class of the function given in the beginning of the codes"
