This Project is a number analyser we get the minimum maximum and average of the numbers using some logic
using while statement we  made sure if an input is made the code should start 
we made use of max.min to get the minimum numbers 
we also used math.max to get the maximum numbers in which the user is going to input 
we also made sure there is logc in which if the user input a negative numbers the input ends there and show all the output of the user input 
there is also a logic to get the sum of all numbers in this code which is sum+= number this logic sum up all the numbers
lastly there is also logic made to get the average numbers of all the numbers input by the user which is 
double average = sum /total count... total count the is amount of digits in which the user inputed
