This code entails about temperature converter to different unit like celsius fahrenheit etc 
it catches error if mistakenly inputed by the user it'd prompt the user to enter correct value 

and also there is logic provided to convert from one unit to another 

string[] inputParts = userInput.Split(' '); - This line splits the userInput string into an array of substrings based on the space character (' '). It assumes that the input contains at least one space character. The result is stored in the inputParts array.

double inputValue = double.Parse(inputParts[0]); - This line parses the first element of the inputParts array (presumably a numerical value represented as a string) into a double-precision floating-point number (double). It assumes that the first part of the input string represents a valid numerical value.

char unit = char.ToUpper(inputParts[1][0]); - This line takes the first character of the second element of the inputParts array, converts it to uppercase using the ToUpper() method, and assigns it to the unit variable. It assumes that the second part of the input string represents a single character (which is then converted to uppercase).

Overall, this code takes a user input string, assumes it consists of at least two parts separated by a space character, parses the first part into a double value, and takes the first character of the second part, converting it to uppercase. This kind of processing is common when dealing with input that represents numerical values followed by units, such as "10 cm" etc
